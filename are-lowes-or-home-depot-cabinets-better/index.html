KNAACK Wall in the Jobsite Boxes department at From lowes.com
I went with home depot in my area instead of lowes because i liked the designer better, but they both gave me a free design. They do a decent job but with the markup from lowes and hd you pay top dollar, usually about 50% more than the contractor would have charged you directly. We ordered and paid in full for custom kitchen cabinets from lowe�s 294 days (over 9 months!!!) ago and so far, it has cost us more than $10,000 beyond what we agreed to pay. Benjamin moore is known for its quality but caters to customers who want to spend quite a lot of money on paints.
