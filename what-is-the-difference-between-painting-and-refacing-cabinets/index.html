Difference between Refacing and Refinishing From idealhomeimprov.com
Cabinet refinishing typically refers to working with your existing cabinet doors and stripping off the paint or stain so that you can start fresh with any color you want.

There is a significant difference between painting and refacing cabinets, with the latter being an investment that yields far better results both in the short and long term. The real difference between painting (or refinishing) and refacing your cabinets is relatively straight forward.
