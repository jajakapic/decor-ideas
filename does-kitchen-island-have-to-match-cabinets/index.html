Two tone kitchen. Island has a wood counter top to match From pinterest.com
I love to mix finishes in a kitchen because i think it adds character and a timeless quality to the room. You can also add dimension to the look of your kitchen by using accent pieces. Each time materials, finish and paint colors are changed, it adds complexity and time to the job which also increases costs. When selecting countertops, you’d want to go for a countertop material that offers excellent resistance to spills, stains and moisture in these areas.
