<p>Trying to decide what is going to be more value for money out of wren and howdens, used wren ages ago when budget was £3k and wasn’t overly impressed with service but i hear they are much better now days. Also, what are german kitchens? Comparative price to ikea, but twice the quality. With howdens you can usually ger replacements straight away.</p>

<p>Have looked at b&amp;q kitchens but not that impressed with the quality, but have a limited budget as we are renovating a whole house. B&amp;q kitchens are the worst company that i have ever had the misfortune to come across! We cannot give a decision which kitchen brand is good but in my point of view, magnet kitchen is much better than howden kitchen because magnet kitchen has more advantages than howden kitchen like, it has great software which shows 360 images of the kitchen to see the client how his kitchen see after installing magnet kitchen.

<p>The kitchen fitter i�m using also uses howdens, so i�ve looked on their website and am impressed, and also the rental property we are in at the moment has a basic howdens kitchen and the units are good quality compared to b&amp;q.

Our first flat had a howdens kitchen and we were impressed with the beating it took over the years (!) but we didn’t let this get in the way of a getting a good deal, if it meant getting a similar quality for a better price, so we gave ikea kitchens and b&amp;q kitchens some real consideration. You have to find your own fitter and they do not recommend one. bq kitchens Google Search Kitchen design, Howdens.</p>

<p>I�m more asking about how the kitchens actually stack up quality wise, after sales service, guarantees and are they honoured or do you have to argue with them. It’s not even a howdens kitchen review (who we eventually went with). Comparative price to ikea, but twice the quality. Kitchens that are much better value than Howdens, Wickes.</p>

<p>The main difference seems to be that howdens are glued and b&amp;q are flat pack.
